## This repository contains the scripts used to produce the results and figures of the manuscript entitled "Biological Constraints Can Improve Prediction in Precision Oncology"

1. Bladder: the scripts used for data collection and training agnostic and mechanistic models to predict bladder cancer progression in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients.
2. Breast: the scripts used to collect the gene expression datasets and also to train the models to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with triple-negative breast cancer.
3. Prostate: the scripts used for collecting and processing the prostate gene expression datasets and for training the models to predict metastasis in primary prostate cancer.
4. ICB_Response: the scripts used in predicting the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with melanoma.
3. GenePairs: contains the lists of mechanistic gene pairs: a) FFLs: feed-forward loops consisting of TFs and miRNA target genes; b) MYC_Pairs: pairs of genes up- and down-regulated by MYC; c) NOTCH_Pairs: pairs of genes up- and down-regulated by NOTCH signaling or those involved in the up- or down-regulation of NOTCH signaling pathway; d) metastasis_pairs: pairs of genes involved in cell adhesion, activation, and O2 response; and e) immune_pairs: pairs of genes involved in T cell activation and cytokines production.
